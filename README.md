# DistanceEstimator

This ROS node is used for the estimation of the pose and distance of a UAV equipped with UV LED markers with the use of an event-based camera.

The setup in `tmux/start.sh` / `tmux/session.yml` shows a sample dataset recorded with ground truth positions present.

It could be run using the `mrs_apptainer`, which can be set up from its repository [https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_apptainer](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_apptainer).
